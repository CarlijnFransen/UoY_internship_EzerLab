=> Accessing the feature_levels YAML file
Using standard /shared/storage/biology/rsrch/de656/lab/projects/project_CarlijnFransen/miniconda/envs/rna_stuff/lib/perl5/site_perl/auto/share/dist/AGAT/feature_levels.yaml file
=> Attribute used to group features when no Parent/ID relationship exists (i.e common tag):
	* locus_tag
	* gene_id
=> merge_loci option deactivated
=> Machine information:
	This script is being run by perl v5.32.1
	Bioperl location being used: /shared/storage/biology/rsrch/de656/lab/projects/project_CarlijnFransen/miniconda/envs/rna_stuff/lib/perl5/site_perl/Bio/
	Operating system being used: linux 
=> Accessing Ontology
	No ontology accessible from the gff file header!
	We use the SOFA ontology distributed with AGAT:
		/shared/storage/biology/rsrch/de656/lab/projects/project_CarlijnFransen/miniconda/envs/rna_stuff/lib/perl5/site_perl/auto/share/dist/AGAT/so.obo
	Read ontology /shared/storage/biology/rsrch/de656/lab/projects/project_CarlijnFransen/miniconda/envs/rna_stuff/lib/perl5/site_perl/auto/share/dist/AGAT/so.obo:
		4 root terms, and 2596 total terms, and 1516 leaf terms
	Filtering ontology:
The feature type (3rd column) is constrained to be either a term from the Sequence Ontology or an SO accession number. The latter alternative is distinguished using the syntax SO:000000. In either case, it must be sequence_feature (SO:0000110) or an is_a child of it.
We filter the ontology to apply this rule.		We found 1861 terms that are sequence_feature or is_a child of it.
